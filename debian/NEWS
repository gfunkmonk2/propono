propono (2.23.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Since 2.23.4, Propono follows the XDG Base Directory Specification,
    which means it will use ~/.local/share/propono to store bookmarks,
    instead of ~/.mate2/propono.bookmarks. The migration will happen
    automatically if there's no ~/.local/share/propono file yet.
